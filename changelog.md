# Changelog
This is here to keep a papertrail of the things I'm doing/have been doing. Hopefully this can bridge any gaps of long periods of time not working on this.

## August 9th
* Finished adding descriptive comments for the code
* Renamed to appSage
* Made publicly available on GitHub and added LICENSE and community docs

## August 2nd
* Iterated through a bunch of UX quirks

## July 24th
* Most of the sidebar is now finished with both functionality and better UI/UX
* The copy/paste feature simply pulls compiled CSS from the `<head>` tag and adds it to the clipboard for quick and easy one-click exporting
* Restructured folders quite a bit to hopefully make more sense and less messy

## July 20th
* Ready to make passable page that can be used in a live site.

## July 14, 2024
* Finally learn from the below and begin restructuring to click-based design, drag and drop is too unintutive without thousands of hours of fine tweaking.
* Replace everything previous with a click-based contemporary (outside of maybe a couple of things).

## Jan. 27, 2024
* Hacked out the "mobile view" â€” it was buggy, confusing, and will create too much scope creep when trying to finalize an MVP.

## Sometime in October 2023
* Build out a drag and drop editor and get absolutely bogged down by the BS that comes from drag and drop.
