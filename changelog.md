# Wtf is this
This is here to keep a papertrail of the things I'm doing/have been doing. Hopefully this can bridge any gaps of long periods of time not working on this.

## Jan. 27, 2024
* Hacked out the "mobile view" â€” it was buggy, confusing, and will create too much scope creep when trying to finalize an MVP.

## July 14, 2024
* Begin restructuring to click-based design, drag and drop is too unintutive without thousands of hours of fine tweaking.
* Replace everything previous with a click-based contemporary (outside of maybe a couple of things).

## July 20th
* Ready to make passable page that can be used in a live site.
