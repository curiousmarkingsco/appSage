# Placeholder Media
This folder is for using placeholder content in your layout design. This is useful for showing the a piece of media "should exist here" without distracting non-industry people from the content itself. This is for avoiding scenarios where the client might say, "I don't like that picture, can we use a different picture?"

## TODO
The audio and media is a blatant self-promotion on the behalf of the creator of this repository's amateur comedy. If you know of a better open-licensed placeholder for audio/video that is far more generic, please replace `audio.mp3` and `video.mp4` with them and make a pull request.
